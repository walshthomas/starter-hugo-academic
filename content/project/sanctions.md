summary: <span style="font-family:Lora">*joint with Josep Amer-Mestre and Marta C. Lopes*</span></br></br><p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Lora">Using data from Google Trends in Italy, we study how different regions reacted to the implementation of online learning through national-wide platforms, such as Google Classroom and WeSchool, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Regions with a previously lower academic performance, actively searched more in Google about e-learning tools, surpassing regions with earlier school closures. Analysing school administrative data before the pandemic we find that teachers in lower performing regions were already using other e-learning tools more than higher performing regions. Complementing this with survey data for students we find that the ones in lower performing regions were also relying more on internet to follow up school lessons and attend additional tutorials. Unlike studies in other countries, our findings suggest that the COVID-19 shock may not change the lower academic performance regions behaviour in their usage of e-learning. </br></br><ins>Presented at</ins>&colon; IAB Inequality Seminar 2021; 2nd Joint IZA & Jacobs Center Workshop&colon; Consequences of Covid-19 for Child and Youth Development.</span>
