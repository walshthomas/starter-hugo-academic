 <b>Working Papers</b>:

 <p style="color:red;"> Sectoral Volatility and the Investment Channel of Monetary Policy <br>
  (with Ozgen Ozturk, available on request)</p>
<p><small>How does the dispersion of firm-level shocks affect firms’ investment behaviour, and what are the
implications for monetary policy effectiveness? Using firm-level panel data, this paper explores how
sectoral volatility of idiosyncratic productivity (total factor productivity in revenue, TFPR) affects monetary
policy transmission via the investment decisions of firms. In the cross-section and panel dimensions,
we find policy has dampened real effects due to higher volatility of shocks. Given that dispersion
rises in recessions, these findings offer further evidence as to why monetary policy is weaker in recessions.</small></p>
