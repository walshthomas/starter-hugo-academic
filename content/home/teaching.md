<p><small>How does the dispersion of firm-level shocks affect the investment channel of monetary policy? Using firm-level panel data, we construct several measures of dispersion of shocks, time-pooled and time-varying, and interact high-frequency identified monetary policy shocks with these measures of idiosyncratic shock volatility. We document a novel fact: monetary policy has dampened real effects via the investment channel when firm-level TFP shock volatility is high. Our estimates for dampening effects of volatility are statistically and economically significant - moving from the tenth to the ninetieth percentile of the volatility distribution approximately halves point estimates of impulse response functions to contractionary monetary policy shocks. Given that dispersion rises in recessions, these
findings offer further evidence as to why monetary policy is weaker in recessions, and emphasize the importance of firm heterogeneity in monetary policy transmission.</small></p></li></ul>

<h2>Work in Progress:</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<h5> Job Search under the Threat of Sanctions</h5>
<p><small>How does the threat of punishment in the unemployment insurance system affect job search behaviours and subsequent labour market outcomes? This project uses a difference-in-differences design, leveraging the differential response of districts to largescale welfare reform in the United Kingdom during the early 2010s to examine the impact of unemployment benefit sanctioning threat on jobseeker exit from unemployment and future outcomes. Constructing working life histories from panel survey data, result show that average district sanctioning rate increases the rate at which jobseekers exit unemployment signficantly.</small></p></li></ul>
